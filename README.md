## Welcome To DataTier.Net Home

Update 8.11.2019: I just published a new video on YouTube: 'How To Create Custom Methods With DataTier.Net':

Update 8.7.2019: 
I just create a new video 'Build A Complete C# / SQL Server Application In 15 Minutes With DataTier.Net' (thanks to NuGet magic).

DataTier.Net is an all stored procedure alternative to Entity Framework. 

After cloning, right click the solution and select 'Manage Nuget Packages for Solution'. Then click the 'Restore' button.

Rebuild the solution. You may need to set DataTier.Net.Client project as the Startup Project:
DataTier.Net\DataTier.Net\Client

I also included a new Connection String Builder form.

Please visit my YouTube channel to see the latest videos on DataTier.Net.

This page will be updated as I just learned how to use Git Hub pages today.

Update 7.13.2019: I learned how to install Project Templates using VSIX installers, so now using DataTier.Net
is easier than ever before.

I updated the Quick Start Guide in both Word and PDF format, which is located in the DataTier.Net Class Room here:
